The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 3rd, Saturday, 2021].

### Day 0 : April 2
Learnt a lot about Git and GitHub today. Planned the next 5 days.

**Thoughts**
Felt bad breaking the previous streak but also glad that I chose to restart. Hope to keep up this time.  

### Day 1 : April 3
Continued solving Python Practice challenges. Did 15 questions. In total 95/115 completed.

**Thoughts**
Progress was slow but I learnt and revised a lot today.

### Day 2 : April 4
Completed all Python practice challenges on HackerRank. 

**Thoughts**
Couldn't complete half of what was planned for today. But I'm also happy to complete the practice challenges finally
