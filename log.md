# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 - [Mugdha Basak]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 3rd, Saturday, 2021].

### Day 0 : April 2
Learnt a lot about Git and GitHub today. Planned the next 5 days.

**Thoughts**
Felt bad breaking the previous streak but also glad that I chose to restart. Hope to keep up this time.  

### Day 1 : April 3
Continued solving Python Practice challenges. Did 15 questions. In total 95/115 completed.

**Thoughts**
Progress was slow but I learnt and revised a lot today.

### Day 2 : April 4
Completed all Python practice challenges on HackerRank. 

**Thoughts**
Couldn't complete half of what was planned for today. But I'm also happy to complete the practice challenges finally

### Day 3 : April 5
Completed Python(Basic) skill certification on HackerRank. Completed all "beyond" excercises of excercises 1 and 2 from Python Workouts

**Thoughts**
Again. Didn't complete half of what I planned. Am I packing in more than I can actually do in a day? Or maybe I'm getting distracted a lot.
