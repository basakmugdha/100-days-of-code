# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0-4: March 18 - 22, 2021

**So Far Progress**: Completed 12/17 subdomains of Python Practice Challenges on HackerRank. Started solving from two amazing books, "Tiny Python Projects" and "Python Workout" on day 1 but didn't fork the repos yet.

**Thoughts:** I struggled to keep up the pace I set on day one. But slow progress is better than no progress. Hope to do better ahead.
