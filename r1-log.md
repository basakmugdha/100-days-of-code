# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 1 - [Mugdha Basak]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 1st, Saturday, 2021].

## Day 1: March 1, Saturday
Started solving Array problems today. Spent 2 hours, got stuck, only completed 2 questions. But I solved them several ways. Decided to pickup C++ again.

## Thoughts
First day. Slow start but I think I'm gonna run longer this time.
